                <h5 id="what-went-right-in-the-development-process">What went right in the development process?</h5>
<p>It was fascinating to see how Git played a major role in managing workspaces and improve the team’s cooperation. We used tools like assigning tasks and creating deadlines to organize the task distribution throughout each iteration. With Android Studio we could see the how the tools we learned to use allowed our application grows from iteration to iteration.</p>
<p>Working with code that others created turned out to be really smooth. Most code was well written and allowed for people who didn&rsquo;t originally create a class to easily work with or add to it. We loved being able to read a new class file and instantly be able to incorporate it or add to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="what-went-wrong-in-the-development-process">What went wrong in the development process?</h5>
<p>Our original vision of the app was grander than what we were able to produce. Early on it became clear that we would not be able to fully produce our original idea as seemingly simple tasks took up more time than expected. For each iteration we pushed several tasks into future milestones, most of which were UI related as they were the most demanding.</p>
<p>Group specialization was both a benefit and a hinderance. If a member of the group would display expertise in an area, they would typically be the primary dev for that area. The work done would be high quality however this often resulted in worklog backups. People would be stuck having to wait for a specific task to be done but everyone would rather have the assigned expert handle it as that person would probably do the best job. In some cases, this caused delays and would result in members being overworked if an iteration involved a lot from their field of expertise.</p>
<p>As a group we had the tendency to delay the start of our iterations. Each iteration we ran out of time to complete all the features we planned and had to push them forward. This had a cascading effect through the project and resulted in the final app missing some of the features we planned to have.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-do-differently-if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over">What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</h5>
<p>One of the things we would change is making sure all team members are equally comfortable using Android Studios. If we all had the same knowledge it would have made Android Studios easier to work with. Android Studio both provides sophisticated facility to code and design but also hinders the programmer’s ability and pace.</p>
<p>For future projects it would be important to get everyone involved as equally as possible in each area of the project. You will always have members that are gifted in some areas and not gifted in others, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean you can only rely on a single person for large sections of the project. It is important to have people able to step in when others are getting overwhelmed to lighten the workload and allow for the project to keep moving forward at a good pace even if code quality might suffer.</p>
<p>As a group being motivated to start each iteration sooner would benefit the final product.  We constantly faced time crunches which negatively impacted what we could accomplish each iteration. By starting sooner we would be able to achieve more each iteration would decrease the stress of having to make up for lost time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="did-you-improve-on-the-criteria-you-identified-in-your-iteration-2-retrospective">Did you improve on the criteria you identified in your iteration 2 retrospective?</h5>
<p>The two main issues we identified from the second iteration were starting sooner and splitting up tasks more evenly between members. We did start the iteration sooner than the previous ones, but it was not as early as we intended. Given the circumstances it is fair to say we met this personal goal. The work was split more evenly between members and the everyone was more involved in assigning tasks.</p>
