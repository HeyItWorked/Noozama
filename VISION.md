# Noozama


### Noozama Vision Statement
*Noozama* will be used as a mobile shopping companion for customers to order items -- *normally sold physically over multiple stores or vendors* -- over the convenience of the Internet. *Noozama* will be readily available to customers through an app center of their choice, and will feature a wide variety of features to enhance their shopping experience. 

#### Features
*Noozama* will feature a payment system that will accept multiple payment methods (credit cards, gift cards, or other third-party payment sources) that will allow customers to purchase products through our platform service.

Customers will be welcomed with an assortment of categorically assorted items to view, such as items on sale or under a certain promotion. *Noozama* will feature a search system that will enable customers to find items by name, with an optional, additional set of filtering options that will enable them to sort search results by related category, price range, amongst other criteria. 

Customers will be able to view additional information on a specific product, including any additional descriptions, details, and possible variations (color, model, etc.). Based on the information of the current product being viewed, similar items will be suggested for customers to view and/or purchase. When viewing information on items, customers will be able to rate products (and consequently view others’ ratings) based on their subjective overall satisfaction. 

*Noozama* will include an automatically saving, mnemonic “shopping cart” feature, allowing customers to view and edit items they plan to purchase, while also maintaining the list if they decide to continue browsing the platform service. *Noozama* will also feature a user account system (optional for customers), enabling customers to view their search history as well as their logged purchases. 

#### Demographic and Value
Our *Noozama* service platform’s demographic will primarily be targeted at the general populace, with specific attention paid to  customers *within the ages 15 to 64 years-old*. *Noozama* can be of great value for our targeted demographic: for the younger side of the demographic spectrum, *Noozama* will serve as a complementary aid with shopping overall, allowing for quick purchases that can accommodate a busy lifestyle; for the older side of the spectrum, *Noozama* can act as a near-replacement to physical shopping, adding to the relief of an older customer demographic, who may not be as able-bodied as their younger customer counterparts.

#### Success Criteria
*Noozama* will be considered a success based on several criteria. First, after initial exposure and use, customers will be interviewed to compare their experience(s) with the system against traditional, physical shopping, and if customers prefer *Noozama*’s shopping services over traditional shopping (with observable results such as time spent to obtain shopping items, as well as perceived convenience). Additionally, the changes of sales at physical stores/vendors as a result of *Noozama*’s influence will also be considered as a success if a statistically-significant increase in sales within the stores/vendors is observed.
