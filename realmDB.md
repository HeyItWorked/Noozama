=========

## What is Realm?

Realm is an open source object database management system, initially for mobile (Android/iOS),also available for platforms such as Xamarinor React Native, and others, including desktop applications (Windows), and is licensed under the Apache License.

Realm is an object-oriented database that uses C++ as its core.

In September 2016, the Realm Mobile Platform was announced, followed by the first stable release in January 2017. It allows two-way synchronization between the Realm Object Server, and the client side databases that belong to the given logged-in user. Both a developer, and a commercial edition was released, along with a business license for integrating with other database management systems such as PostgreSQL.

On April 24, 2019 Realm announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by MongoDB.

## What is object-oriented database?

An object-oriented database is organized around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic. Therefore, an object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and Swift.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
